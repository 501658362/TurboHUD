		NOTE1: if there is at least 1 elite on the screen then the number goes red and the value is increased by the elite damage bonus
		NOTE2: currently there is no FACT about how D3 calculates the different damage bonuses. We know that the "grand elite bonus" is calculated by each items' elite bonus with a diminishing formula = 1-(1-a)*(1-b)*(1-..)
